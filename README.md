ECON   7600:      Trade   and   Development,   Fall   2024 
1            Objectives The   first   half   of   this   course   studies   two   fundamental   questions   in   the   eco-nomics   of   international   trade:    (a) Why   do   countries   trade   with   one   another?   (b)   What   factors   determine   how the   gains   from trade   are   distributed across   as   well   as    within countries?       Answers   to   these   questions   are   built   around   three   key   economic   concepts:   comparative   advantage,   economies   of   scale,   and   imperfect   competition.   We   will   cover   these   concepts   in   detail   and   with   care.   The second half of the course is dedicated to trade policy issues, partic-   ularly   those   that   are   of special   relevance   to   developing   countries. Questions   addressed include:   (1) Why is free trade so often   preached and so rarely prac-   ticed?    (2)   What   are   the   effects   of various   types   of government   intervention   in   trade?    (3) What   role   does   the   World   Trade   Organization   (WTO)   play   in facilitating global trade   liberalization?
3            Requirements Textbook   and   Readings:      The   recommended   textbook   for   this   class   is   International   Trade   (5th   Edition)   by   Robert   C.   Feenstra   and   Alan   M.   Tay-   lor.   You   will   also   be   given   lecture   slides   for   much   of the   material   covered   in   this   course.   In   addition,   I   will   frequently   circulate   readings   during   class, via e-mail,   or   via   Brightspace.    You   may   also   find   it   useful   to   consult Interna-   tional   Trade: Theory   and   Policy      (11th   Edition)   by   Paul   Krugman,   MauriceObstfeld,   and   Marc   Melitz.    A   good   discussion   of   some   contemporary   trade   policy issues can be found in   Free Trade   under Fire    (5th   edition) by   Douglas   A.   Irwin,   Princeton   University   Press,   2020.Evaluation:    Your   grade   in   this   course   will   be   based   on   (a)   homework   as-   signments   and   class   participation   (10%   of   course   grade)   (b)   two   mid-terms   exams   (on   October   8th   and   November   19th;   each   exam   counts   for   30%   of   course   grade),   and   (c)   an   in-class   presentation   of   a   slide   deck   (10-15   slides;   30% of   course grade) analyzing a major policy issue in international trade and   economic   development.   More   information   on   the   slide   deck   is   given   below.Make-up   Exams:   Make   up   exams   will   be   given   only   in   case   of   real   emer-   gencies   (such   as   serious   medical   problems   or   death   in   the   family)   for   which   you   can   provide   supporting   documentation.Vanderbilt   Honor   Code:   Vanderbilt University students pursue all   acad-   emic   endeavors   with   integrity.    They   conduct   themselves   honorably,   profes-   sionally,   and   respectfully   in   all   realms   of   their   studies   in   order   to   promote   and   secure   an   atmosphere   of   dignity   and   trust.    The   keystone   of   the   honor   system   is   self-regulation,   which   requires   cooperation   and   support   from   each   member   of   the   University   community.

Four   major   sources   for   information   on   international   trade   and   the   trade   pol-   icy   environment   of countries   are:
1.   The   WTO's   web-site   www.wto.org   has   a   wealth   of   information   regard-   ing its various   agreements   and international disputes   amongst   member   countries.   It   is   a   good   idea   to   familiarize   yourself   with   this   web-site.
2.   Trade   policy   reviews   of   WTO   members:   wto.org/english/tratop_e/tpr_e/tpr_e.htm.
3.      Country   data   from   the   World   Bank:    data.worldbank.org.
4.    Discussions of   current trade issues by Chad Bown and Soumaya Keynes:   piie.com/trade-talks.
5            Possible   topics   for   trade   policy   issues 
1.   Does   the   possibility   of   global   pandemics    (such    as    COVID-19)    raise   new   questions/concerns   regarding   the   desirability   of   world   trade   and globalization?
2.   Is   vaccine   nationalism justified?   Why   or   Why   not?
3.   Are   differences   in   sanitary   and   phytosanitary   standards   across   coun-   tries   legitimate   barriers   to   trade?      If   so,   who   bears   the   cost   of   these   differences?
4.   Trade liberalization increases inequality in developing countries.    Argue   for   or   against   this   statement   using   empirical   evidence   and   studies.
5.   Investigate   a   specific   instance   of trade   policy   interventions   such   as   the   imposition   of   US   tariffs   on   imports   of   washing   machines   from   China   in 2018.
6.   How   would   the   requirement   of minimum   wages   in   the   Mexican   manu-   facturing   sector   affect   welfare   in   the   US   and   Mexico?
7.   Does   stronger   protection   of   intellectual   property   rights   in   developing   countries   improve   global   welfare?
8.   Would   the   US   be   better   off after   increasing   tariffs   on   foreign-made   airplanes   (e.g.   Airbus   planes   not   made   in   Mobile,   Alabama)?
9.   Would   providing   more   trade   protection   to   the   US   solar   panel   industry be justified?
10.    Should   the   use   of   industrial   policy   by   a   country - such   as   the   granting of   artificially   low   interest   loans   in   a   particular   industry   -    affect   the trade   policies   of   its   trading   partners?
11.    Can   dependence   on   foreign   suppliers   compromise   a   countryís   national   security?   If yes, how should a country balance gains from trade against   security?
12.   How   well   is   the   WTO's   dispute   settlement   system   working?      Does   it   need   reform?
13.   Is free trade good for   the   environment?    Focus on   a   particular   industry   or   product   to   examine   this   question.
